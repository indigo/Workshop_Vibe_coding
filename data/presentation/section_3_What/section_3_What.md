# SECTION 3: \"THE WHAT\" - Your Solution (The Need for Description & Approval)

So, with AI being so powerful, do we still need artists, coders, and other experts? Absolutely, YES!
(short pause)
Why? Because being an expert, in many ways, is about your ability to **describe something precisely**. It's about truly knowing the "code" of that something. A director of photography sees and can describe light, shadow, and reflection in minute detail. A programmer sees and understands the logic within lines of code.
(pause)
It's this deep understanding, this ability to articulate the essence, that we need. We need experts to craft the detailed descriptions that will guide AI, to critique what AI produces against a well-defined creative intent, and ultimately, to put their name on the final work and take responsibility for it.
(pause)
Think about modern art. Sometimes you see a plain white canvas in a museum, signed by an artist. Making a white canvas isn't technically hard.
(short pause)
But it’s there, signed. The artist’s idea, their intent, their "code" for that piece, and their choice to show it – that’s what makes it art. AI can paint the canvas, but who defines and defends the "code" behind it?

It’s the same with AI. Imagine an AI making an eight-hour movie from one command. That’s impressive! But would you put your name on it without checking it, without agreeing it’s what you wanted?
(short pause)
For big projects, we need to spend hours looking, judging, and approving. A product is ready when the team agrees it’s good, when they all back the creative idea.

And that’s just how creating things works. Think about making a movie. There are steps you *can't* skip, like making a storyboard. It’s not just a task; it’s a key part of defining the story.
(short pause)
Any project is really a collection of connected "data" or "ingredients" – characters, places, props, scripts, art ideas, references, lighting. This "data" is the real heart of the project.

So, for us creators using AI, two things are essential:
(short pause)
First, we need a way to **describe our ideas very clearly**. This clear description is what will guide the AI.
(pause)
Second, we need to **always have access to, and control over, this descriptive data**. No temporary files that disappear. As professionals, we need to create this data, check it, improve it, and approve it.

So, I asked myself: What kind of tool, what way of working, could **help experts do their best work** with AI?
(short pause)
How could we give them an easy and effective way to work together, while keeping control and being clear? How can a team look at their project data together, with everyone bringing their own expertise?

Answering these questions led me to develop an approach… a method I call VibeLogic.
(short pause)
It’s based on using the smart AI agents that are already on our computers and in the tools we use every day.
(pause)
The main idea is to organize our work, our descriptions, so these AI agents can help us in the best way. The VibeLogic tool then helps **support this method**. It makes it easier to structure the data, and it gives a clear view of how things are organized and if they’re approved. It’s a **service** for experts, to help them with these needs.
