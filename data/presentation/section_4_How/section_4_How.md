# Section 4: How

Structure your data
Describe your data
Work and Approve your data

We use a 3 different types of files:

The Type
Used to describe a type of Resource that makes sense for this project. Can be Characters, Locations, Dialogs, anything that makes sense for your business logic.

The Resource
The entity, the subject of a type, for example a Character

The Asset
A file that is produced or used as a reference within a Resource.

Easy, and very flexible.

Now the MCP server can be added to the agent.

We develop this server to sit on top of the data and help us follow up the project, link items, and approve items.


The 2 super powers brought by AI
Approving things
Status reports, Meetings

That's where AI shines, because this kind of things are very hard to code with our traditionnal tools and technics. But with their reasoning, LLMs can simply play a huge role into our processes.

Power 1 - Complex Approvals
Imagine a situation where you have a team in place. The boss care a lot about the Characters and their back stories. Complex approval strategies are not a problem anymore.

Power 2 - Meeting reports
Filling in meeting transcripts and status check.
We consider that meetings should actually serve a purpose :)
So we have integratied a status report tool that is actually creating resources within you project directly. So statuses are really part of your data, and can be analyzed properly to generate a proper follow up.
