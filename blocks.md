**FULL REVISED PROMPTER SCRIPT - RICHARD RISPOLI'S TALK (English - Baseline Version / Practice Version 3)**

**(SECTION 1: HOOK / INTRODUCTION - Your Vision & The AI Context)**

**(BLOCK 1)**
I’ve always seen computers as tools. Tools to automate the boring, repetitive parts of making things digitally.
(short pause)
Think of it like going from a pencil to a smart pen. It helps us create exactly what we imagine, much more easily.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 2 - Revised with "Assistant Hands" - Placeholder Variation A from earlier discussion)**
And today? We’re pretty much there.
(short pause)
But it’s more than just automation. Think of AI today as incredibly capable **assistant hands** – a really good helper, honestly! AI can do so much now, and its progress is amazing. It’s reached a level of power we could call **ultimate** (UL-ti-mit), or very close.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 3)**
But this success brings a big question: If AI can automate so much of the production… what’s our role as creators?
(short pause)
How do we need to change how we work, how we work together? Especially in creative areas like making video games.
(pause)
Many people worry that AI will replace them. And that’s a real concern.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 4)**
This idea of smart automation, and AI's role, isn't new to me. 14 years ago, I worked on the game Tetris at EA Mobile.
(short pause)
Even then, my team trained an AI to predict how players would make their next move. That’s a bit like today’s AI predicting the next word in a sentence. This isn't new; we've been doing that for years. It's just that now, we're getting very good at it.
(pause)
It shows this is an ongoing change we need to understand and guide.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 5)**
So, with this powerful automation… how can we, as creators, do more than just survive? How can we actually thrive?
(short pause)
How do we stay in control and use this amazing power, instead of feeling overwhelmed by it?
(significant pause)

**(SECTION 2: "THE WHY" - Challenges & Opportunities (The Chess Analogy))**

**(BLOCK 6)**
So, how do we handle this change? Well, let's look at what happened in the world of chess.
(short pause)
AI has been beating the best human players for a long time. Think back to the 90s – Kasparov competing against Deep Blue. Since then, AI has become the undisputed world chess champion. The best chess AIs don't even need to study human games anymore to improve.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 7)**
But here’s the interesting part: even though AI is the best player, more people are playing chess than ever before!
(short pause)
Why? Because chess players use AI every day. Not necessarily because AI is the most *fun* opponent, but because it's the **best way to get better at chess**. They use AI to practice, to deeply analyze their games, and to prepare their strategies for playing against other humans.
(pause)
The chess community accepted AI as a powerful training partner, an essential tool for improvement... not an enemy.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 8)**
This chess story is a great lesson for all of us in creative fields. We should see AI as an opportunity – an opportunity to learn, to get better at what we are already good at, what we like to do.
(short pause)
And think about how those chess programs evolved: before modern AI, like LLMs and Transformers, the best chess engines were built with millions of lines of complex, hand-crafted code. Now? It's more like one big "brain" that largely trains itself on the game.
(pause)
The same kind of simplification can happen in our work. Today’s AI can help simplify a lot of our complex coding tasks. Things that used to need thousands of lines of specific instructions can now be handled more elegantly by an AI that can think and adapt.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 9)**
But yes, there’s a lot of worry right now, especially in video games. These AIs can create things that seem as good as, or even better than, what some humans can do… just like in chess.
(short pause)
So the big question is: how do we use AI constructively, and stay in control?
(significant pause)

**(SECTION 3: "THE WHAT" - Your Solution (The Need for Description & Approval))**

**(BLOCK 10 - REVISED with Expertise Insight)**
So, with AI being so powerful, do we still need artists, coders, and other experts? Absolutely, YES!
(short pause)
Why? Because being an expert, in many ways, is about your ability to **describe something precisely**. It's about truly knowing the "code" of that something. A director of photography sees and can describe light, shadow, and reflection in minute detail. A programmer sees and understands the logic within lines of code.
(pause)
It's this deep understanding, this ability to articulate the essence, that we need. We need experts to craft the detailed descriptions that will guide AI, to critique what AI produces against a well-defined creative intent, and ultimately, to put their name on the final work and take responsibility for it.
(pause)
Think about modern art. Sometimes you see a plain white canvas in a museum, signed by an artist. Making a white canvas isn't technically hard.
(short pause)
But it’s there, signed. The artist’s idea, their intent, their "code" for that piece, and their choice to show it – that’s what makes it art. AI can paint the canvas, but who defines and defends the "code" behind it?
(pause)

**(BLOCK 11)**
It’s the same with AI. Imagine an AI making an eight-hour movie from one command. That’s impressive! But would you put your name on it without checking it, without agreeing it’s what you wanted?
(short pause)
For big projects, we need to spend hours looking, judging, and approving. A product is ready when the team agrees it’s good, when they all back the creative idea.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 12)**
And that’s just how creating things works. Think about making a movie. There are steps you *can't* skip, like making a storyboard. It’s not just a task; it’s a key part of defining the story.
(short pause)
Any project is really a collection of connected "data" or "ingredients" – characters, places, props, scripts, art ideas, references, lighting. This "data" is the real heart of the project.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 13)**
So, for us creators using AI, two things are essential:
(short pause)
First, we need a way to **describe our ideas very clearly**. This clear description is what will guide the AI.
(pause)
Second, we need to **always have access to, and control over, this descriptive data**. No temporary files that disappear. As professionals, we need to create this data, check it, improve it, and approve it.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 14)**
So, I asked myself: What kind of tool, what way of working, could **help experts do their best work** with AI?
(short pause)
How could we give them an easy and effective way to work together, while keeping control and being clear? How can a team look at their project data together, with everyone bringing their own expertise?
(pause)

**(BLOCK 15 - Revised, emphasizing methodology & existing agents)**
Answering these questions led me to develop an approach… a method I call VibeLogic.
(short pause)
It’s based on using the smart AI agents that are already on our computers and in the tools we use every day.
(pause)
The main idea is to organize our work, our descriptions, so these AI agents can help us in the best way. The VibeLogic tool then helps **support this method**. It makes it easier to structure the data, and it gives a clear view of how things are organized and if they’re approved. It’s a **service** for experts, to help them with these needs.
(significant pause)

---

**(SECTION 4: "THE HOW" - Part 1: Character Example & LLM-Assisted Approval)**

**(BLOCK 16)**
Let’s look at a real example: creating an important character for a video game. Using an approach like VibeLogic, we’d first describe this character from all angles.
(short pause)
What does it look like? What keywords or pictures will help an AI create some ideas? What’s its story, its personality? What details will define its role, and how can an AI help write a quick bio or some sample dialogue? How does this character talk? How does it connect to other characters?
(pause)
All these descriptions and ideas are saved, organized, and easy to see – maybe like a map showing how everything is connected.
(short pause)

**(BLOCK 17)**
But the most important part is approval. And this is where we can really change things for the better.
(short pause)
Usually, getting things approved is slow and step-by-step: an artist makes something, then an art director checks it, then a game designer... This can cause long delays and a lot of wasted time, especially if one person's decision affects someone else’s work, and nobody sees it right away.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 18)**
But today, AI is able to understand very complex ideas. So why not use that to our advantage in order to approve things?
(short pause)
Imagine: different experts – an artist, a writer, a designer – each with their area of responsibility. They can all give their opinion on the character at the same time. Their comments, worries, ideas, are all gathered in one place.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 19 - Revised with Genre Example & Insight on AI/Logic/Emotion)**
And this is where an AI, built into our system, can be a really helpful assistant for making decisions.
(short pause)
You see, AIs have been trained on a vast amount of text, on how humans reason and discuss. They can articulate things logically, often more consistently than we can, especially when emotion or egos get involved in project discussions – which, let's be honest, happens!
(pause)
So, this AI assistant can:
(short pause)
It can **summarize everyone's feedback**, and point out where people agree or disagree.
(short pause)
It can **suggest compromises** or new ideas, based on what everyone says.
(short pause)
If the team is having a tough discussion – for example, about the game's core **genre**: 'Should we lean more towards a pure Action RPG, or incorporate more Strategy elements?' – the AI can help **clarify the implications**. It could outline common features, target audiences, or potential development challenges associated with each genre, helping the team make a more informed decision.
(short pause)
It can even help the team **vote fairly** on specific points.
(pause)
Essentially, because these LLMs can navigate the complexities of human discussion and point us towards informed decisions, they can effectively replace what would otherwise be extremely complicated systems or code designed to manage these collaborative processes. It can become as simple as a structured chat with an intelligent assistant.
(significant pause)

**(BLOCK 20)**
The goal isn't for AI to make decisions for us. The goal is for AI to **help us agree faster and more easily**.
(short pause)
We should even design the AI to *encourage* us to find common ground and agree more effectively.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 21)**
By helping the team approve things together with AI assistance, we fix one of the biggest problems that slows down projects: not the actual work, but the waiting and the arguments about approvals.
(short pause)
The benefits are clear: the team works better together, decisions are faster and smarter, there’s less frustration. And in the end, we get a character – and a game – that everyone on the team truly believes in. Think of it… that would be beautiful.
(significant pause)

---

**(SECTION 4 (Continued): "THE HOW" - Part 2: Application to Game Production & Distribution)**

**(BLOCK 22)**
Okay, so we've seen how this approach can help create a character. But let's think bigger – about how games are produced and even sold.
(short pause)
This is also changing drastically with AI. Marketing is changing fast.
(short pause)
In this new AI world, making a game isn't just about coding anymore. A game today should almost be marketed *at the same time* it's being produced.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 23)**
When we make a game, we're shaping a dream, an idea, into a game. We're creating an experience.
(short pause)
And that experience should connect with a community of players. It needs to make them *feel* something.
(pause)
So, it's vital to test our ideas. Usually, testing means making a promotional video, or a playable demo. At the very least, you need a video to show people and see if it sparks interest, if you can build a community around it.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 24)**
And this is where AI agents can be amazing assistants.
(short pause)
Making a game is really about creating a community of players who love what your game makes them feel, what it lets them experience.
(pause)
So, on top of helping us be creative quickly, AI can also help us make those crucial early videos. And it can make these videos look like the final game, very quickly.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 25)**
Think about it: if we can describe *exactly* what we want our game to be – the mood, the key moments, the style – then AI should be able to create a video of that game very easily.
(short pause)
This uses the same skills game designers and level designers already have. It's the same expertise, but we can apply it differently.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 26 - REVISED with Early Validation Focus & Parallel Dev Insight)**
Focus first on describing the core game experience to create a high-quality **target video**. Test that video, see what makes people tick, and start building a community around that vision from the ground up.
(short pause)
And here’s the key point: once you have these detailed descriptions – the 'assets' for your vision – you **don't have to wait until the end of your project to know if it's a good idea.**
(pause)
Your programmers can start building the *actual* game in parallel, using these clear descriptions as their blueprint. (And whether they're seasoned coders or enjoy "vibe coding" with AI assistants, they'll likely be happier working towards a validated concept!)
(pause)
Then, with that community's interest and early feedback from the video, you can **adjust your development very quickly** towards what the players *really* want. What you develop becomes aligned with the expectations of a real group of people. It makes sense to *them*; it tells *them* a story you're building together.
(pause)
This way, you build momentum early. If you first develop most of your game and *then* do a video, you risk losing a lot of energy and finding out too late if your game will connect with enough players. This approach helps show your game idea is viable in the market *before* you've invested everything.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 27)**
And this isn't just about marketing; it’s about de-risking your personal investment.
(short pause)
Let’s be honest, working six months or a year on a project, and then at the end, nobody buys it… that’s a sad situation. Maybe you built an excellent game, but it didn't connect with an audience because you were too busy making it to build a community.
(pause)
Or maybe, if you had tested the core idea earlier, you could have changed something to make it resonate better. It's hard to know after the fact.
(pause)

**(BLOCK 28)**
But one thing you *can* do is test your product, test your vision, quickly. You can do this by creating "fake footage" – a compelling video of what you *want* the game to be.
(short pause)
If you're good enough at describing exactly what you want, with all the important details, you can get incredible results today. It's not really about the specific video-making tool anymore – many online tools can produce photorealistic results or any style you want.
(pause)
The power is in your ability to *describe*.
(significant pause)

**(BLOCK 29)**
So, I wanted to bring this up because it connects to the business world of making games. Why are we making games? How do they fit into a market? We're not just making art; we're often making products we want to sell.
(short pause)
It’s important to think about how we should be doing things differently in this new AI-powered landscape.
(pause)
