**Workshop: Vibe Coding – Make Worlds, Tell Stories, Build Faster with AI**

**Led by:** Richard Rispoli, AI Consultant Innovation Director @ B2tGame

**Overview**

"Vibe Coding" is a revolutionary approach to rapidly creating interactive content and experiences by using natural language to orchestrate AI, data, and tools. This shifts the focus from traditional coding to achieving desired outcomes quickly. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn to express creative intent through prompts, guide AI to generate assets and logic, and iterate rapidly. We'll build simple web front-ends to display AI-assisted creations and explore adding visual flair by focusing on data and prompts. The goal is to build, visualize, and share your creations faster than ever.

**Who Should Attend?**

This workshop is for creators, builders, and technical professionals looking to accelerate their workflow using AI. This includes Tech Artists, Game Developers, Creative Coders, UI/UX Designers, Content Creators, Storytellers, and AI Practitioners. Attendees should be curious about using AI as a creative partner to build tangible outputs faster. Basic programming knowledge is preferable but not mandatory.

**Key Takeaways**

*   Master a Free "Vibe Coding" workflow: Use natural language prompts to orchestrate the best free AI models, control your data, and tools to *build tangible things*. 
*   Learn to treat AI-generated code as rapid, disposable scaffolding for achieving creative and technical goals (stories, visuals, prototypes, pipelines).
*   Gain hands-on experience crafting prompts specifically designed for *making* – generating content, transforming data, and controlling simple visual outputs.
*   Build simple web pages (HTML/CSS/JS) using AI assistance to instantly display and share your generated content and interactive pieces.
*   Explore practical techniques for adding visual interest (e.g., AI-driven styles, basic generative patterns) by focusing on prompts and data, not deep coding.
*   Understand how to rapidly iterate on creative ideas by focusing on the *outcome* and letting AI handle much of the implementation detail.
*   Critically evaluate when Vibe Coding is most effective and how to use it responsibly to enhance your creative power.

**Session Format**

This is a full-day, hands-on workshop divided into three sessions:

1.  **Morning Session:** Focus on core Vibe Coding concepts and initial hands-on exercises. (2h 30m + QA)
2.  **Afternoon Session:** Deeper dive into practical applications and building more complex projects. (3h 00m + QA)
3.  **Closing Session:** Review, advanced topics/examples, and final Q&A. (1h 00m + QA)

At the end of the day, you will have created your own world, and be a different person.

**Requirements**

*   **Participant Requirements:**
    *   Laptop with a modern web browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended).
    *   Stable internet connection.
    *   (Recommended but optional) Installation of VS Code with GitHub Copilot or Cursor AI extension (or equivalent). Web-based alternatives (e.g., Replit with AI) will be fully supported. Account setup for AI tools may be needed beforehand (guidance provided).
    *   Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, loops, functions). Familiarity with Python or JavaScript is helpful but the focus is on the *AI interaction*.
    *   An eagerness to build, experiment, and partner with AI!
*   **Presenter/Venue Requirements:** Standard presentation setup including reliable internet, projector/screen, and audio.
